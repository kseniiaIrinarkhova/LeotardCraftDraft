# LeotardCraft Draft project
This is the project that provide design draft of LeotardCraft application. Here the main concepts of application are represented.
As an amateur in rhythmiv gymnastic leatard crafter I faced with an issue of information fragmentation while creating the first leotard for my kids. There are a lot of differen sources that provide great ideas, but it really hard to remember all sourses and make plans for work in one place. That is why I desided to create a platform where amators like me or evenm professional could group all resourses that thay need to make their own projects. To see the main concept of that idea and to show my knowledge in HTML and CSS I represent this project.
